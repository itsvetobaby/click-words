Define keywords in an array, or send a request to the server and it will ping them back and place them in the side bar and underline them
i defined this pages keywords in an array. they are  ["hello", "world", "foo", "bar", "baz", "qux", "quux", "corge", "grault", "garply", "waldo", "fred", "plugh", "xyzzy", "thud"]; 
type them and wait a sec and they will underline themselves.

walking text nodes and inserting styled spans is not that easy so i hope this code saved you some time.
